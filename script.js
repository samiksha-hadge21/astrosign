What are an Aries' weaknesses?
All Aries want to feel things intensely. This is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief. Aries tend to be impulsive, impatient, and hotheaded. They are often reacting out of emotion rather than from a place of calm clear-headedness. They do not apologize for their anger. They say “I don’t care” and mean it. They don’t always have the best self-control.

Aries are emotionally direct. They rarely sugarcoat their feelings. They want someone who doesn’t startle or swoon at their bluntness.

Aries tend to be non-conformist, impulsive, and actively seek out the things that scare them. They’re not really into tradition. Due to their eccentric nature, they don’t really believe in monogamy. They’d rather play the field. But, they are also prone to falling so hard that they forget they’re playing at all. Aries want to be impressed. They want a lover who can write their own romantic epic.

If you’re able to handle their trademark volatility, you’ll find that they’re fiercely loyal and emotionally generous.

They’re the kind of person who likes to leave things better than they found them.`

        document.getElementById("result").innerText = `Your Zodiac Sign is :- Taurus (वृषभ राशि) What is the personality of a Taurus?
Tauruses are the human equivalent of moss. A handmade wooden chair. They are normally satisfied with the way things are. They embody stability. Sitting in a patch of grass admiring the breeze. When everything else seems to be falling apart, Tauruses are a rock of dependability in an oasis of calm. Practical knowledge and experience is their modus operandi.

Tauruses are oriented around the physical world. They tend to be grounded and logical. They love routine and they’re committed to their own comfort. They like to be in control. They’re patient and steady, and their materialism is an extension of their pursuit of stability.

Once they get into a groove, it’s difficult for them to get out of it. Object in motion stays in motion. Object at rest stays at rest. Appreciative of beauty. Attuned to physical pleasure. They like things to be predictable. They are perfectly happy eating the same meal over and over, or wearing the same outfit for a week straight. They would prefer things be consistent than chaotically good. They like to discover what they have the most fun doing, and then do it to the extreme.

Tauruses have a regal quality about them. They are graceful and diligent laborers. They can be stubborn, bull-headed, and set in their ways, but they are also great listeners and very dependable.

Tauruses can absolutely go on forever. They are tireless machines. And no matter what someone throws at them, they will inevitably overcome their obstacles because they’ve already prepared for every contingency. They are the hand-built truck that will never break down.

What bad traits do Taureses have?
Some of Tauruses' bad traits have to do with their materialistic tendencies. Sometimes they are overly determined to achieve material success. They are not immune to greed. They can be apathetic to the needs of others if they are motivated to achieve their own goals.

Tauruses don’t respond to criticism. Not even that they negatively react to it, but it’s almost like they are made of cement, and any feedback just bounces right off. They don’t budge.

Tauruses are stubborn. They’re not going to do something they don’t want to do. They’re slow to change their minds because change threatens their sense of stability. They can become so set in their routine that they get too comfortable and lose sight of what really matters. Tauruses can become emotionally and physically lazy.

They can become stubborn and obstinate, and have a hard time listening to other people. They can be like a bull–stuck in the mud, and unable to see the bigger picture. Tauruses are slow to act, and may be too caught up in the moment to see the potential for something bigger. They can also be reckless, especially when they are young. They can struggle with over-indulgence in vices because they don’t know moderation. Once they decide they like something, they go all in.


Who is a Taurus attracted to?
Tauruses are attracted to practical people who make them feel safe and comfortable. People that can cater to the needs that a Taurus may have. A person’s values must align with the values of Taurus. They seek out people that value and appreciate simple pleasures.

Tauruses are attracted to people who are dependable and strong. They will likely be turned off by a person who is constantly flitting around the room or who seems out of control. They are also attracted to people who are self-sufficient and capable of being relaxed. People with a high degree of physical attractiveness are desirable to them. They can easily be turned off by people who aren’t as well dressed as they are or who may seem like they don’t care what they look like. They are often attracted to people who cook, and appreciate a home-cooked dinner.

Tauruses are very loyal, but they also expect loyalty back. They are only willing to invest in relationships that have a firm foundation. They don’t do casual or frivolous. Tauruses don’t tend to be people pleasers because they have a lot of pride. They tend to believe that they are enough without validation from others.`;

        document.getElementById("result").innerText = `Your Zodiac Sign is :- Gemini (मिथुन राशि) What kind of person is a Gemini?
Geminis are very intelligent and pick up knowledge quickly. They are perceptive, analytical, and often very funny. They have an unreserved, childlike curiosity, always asking new questions.

Geminis have an uncanny ability to size up a person’s character in a matter of seconds, even if they only just met them. If someone’s bluffing, they’ll be the first to notice. They are great communicators because they tend to be very responsive and sensitive listeners.

Geminis are versatile, comfortable being both introverts and extroverts. They are quick to adapt to the energy of a room–they can be the life of the party or a complete wallflower. Geminis know how to bring dissimilar people together and make them get along.

What are a Gemini's weaknesses?
Geminis are afraid of being alone. This is why they tend to have large social circles and always have a companion. They’re afraid of being trapped in their own minds. It’s not that Geminis aren’t creative or intelligent, it’s that they’re afraid of the power of their own imagination. They’re afraid of what they’ll find once they finally find themselves.

They’re not afraid of their emotions, but Geminis are constantly worried about how they convey them, about their words being misconstrued, about unintentionally hurting someone’s feelings. This is a common pattern for Geminis, and a result of how they externalize their insecurities. They’re afraid of getting caught up in an emotion that they can’t control. They simply react to their emotions, rather than feel them.

A Gemini mind is an endless race track. They’re constantly scanning under the surface of their current reality for something that they haven’t seen before.

Geminis aren't in a rush to get anywhere, they’re just looking for something new. The most important thing Geminis need to realize is that there is no final destination to be found at the end of the road. They can’t run forever. At some point they’re going to have to stop and look around. To take responsibility for the environment they find themselves in. They’re going to have to look at the world that they’ve built for themselves and decide if it’s really what they want.



Who is a Gemini's soulmate?
A Gemini's soulmate is someone who can help them sort through the chaos of their feelings. They need someone who can help them see the more stable side to their personality. Someone who can help them make sense of their life.

Geminis want to be accepted. They want to be understood. They’re looking for someone who can appreciate their duality and can understand the duality of their shared experience. They’re looking for a partner who can appreciate the complexity of their thoughts and actions.

A Gemini’s soulmate will stimulate their mind and challenge them intellectually. Their partner must be able to keep up with them and be able to communicate on an abstract or physical level without getting too emotional. A Gemini’s soulmate is someone who loves to break away from the mundane and follow their instincts. At the end of the day, a Gemini needs someone who can keep up with their ever-shifting moods.`;

        document.getElementById("result").innerText = `Your Zodiac Sign is :- Cancer (कर्क राशि) What is the personality of a Cancer?
A Cancer’s personality is like wading chest deep in a lake of warm water. It feels sparkling and cool while you're in the shallow end, but you know that if you were to dive in, it would feel warm.

The self-awareness of a Cancer is like the tides–constantly moving in and out of focus. Their personalities are layered. Cancers have many moods, some of which are contradictory, but they also have a deep, core self that persists.

Cancers are weighed down by their own sorrows and the sorrows of those around them. They are frequently haunted by grief. It’s hard for them to share their pain with others, and they are often afraid to be vulnerable because they carry a fear that people will use their weaknesses against them. Cancers have learned to hide their pain to avoid burdening anyone else. They pretend they’re okay when they’re not.

Their emotions are like an exposed nerve. Cancers can feel everything. They’re like a tuning fork that vibrates at the slightest provocation. They tend to carry deep grudges because they can’t forget the emotional sting of even a slight.

What are Cancers attracted to?
Cancers are homebodies. Drawn to stability, routine, and the comfort of the familiar, they don't like change. Cancers like to know what is expected. They tend to be less experimental than others. Traditions and the past captivate their imaginations. They love art that reminds them of a different time, old stories and art forms. Predictable environments make them feel comfortable. They like to know what’s going to happen. They like to feel that they’re part of a bigger plan. They don’t like surprises.


What are Cancers like in relationships?
Cancers can be like a bird that has been caged and hand fed for so long that they begin to believe that they are not capable of surviving in the wild. They can lose the will to fly.

Cancers need a love interest to define them. Their memory is a patchwork of past loves, an impressionist painting of their relationships. Cancers use love as a building block to construct a more concrete sense of self, as their identity is sculpted by people who have made them feel a certain way.

Their role in a relationship is not to dictate its development, but to react to someone else’s lead. They are shaped by their romantic relationships as much as they shape them. Cancers are living, breathing collages of the people who have made them feel special. With each new partner, they become a little more whole.

When a Cancer is in love, they ignore anything negative about the relationship. Because they trust too easily and want to believe the best about everyone, they have a hard time understanding why something feels wrong. They love “nice people.” They can’t understand why everyone isn’t nice. They want to be supportive of everyone.

Cancers need to learn to trust their own instincts and intuition. They need to learn how to survive on their own because being too dependent on someone else will only postpone their healing process.`;

Leos are bold, warm, and loving. They are also the ultimate performers. They can dazzle with the theatrical flair of a Broadway star and the charisma of a politician. They are captivating personalities. No matter how quickly they’ve just been introduced to a topic, they can speak eloquently about almost anything because they have such a way with words.

Leos inject ambition into everything they do. They are ruled by the heart. Their actions are natural and effortless because they are brash and confident and trust their instincts.

Leos have an unrelenting appetite for growth that is easily satiated by the praise of others. When they are hurting, it shows. They will use their anger as a protective wall to shield their vulnerabilities. They want to be perceived as unbreakable because they are scared of admitting vulnerability, needing things from other people, or being incomplete.

What are a Leo's weaknesses?
A Leo's bad sides appear when their admirable character traits cross over into excess. They can be perceived as overbearing, but this is due to their hyper-presence and warmth.

Leos have a reputation for bragging a lot. They see bragging as sharing. Sharing their accomplishments with others makes Leos feel connected, and they expect the same in return from their friends. They want to be celebrated, but they are equally happy to celebrate you.

Leos like to feel important. They don’t necessarily want to be worshipped. They just want to be recognized for their authentic selves. The difference between admiration and worship is subtle, but it’s the difference between a Leo being preoccupied with themselves, or being focused on the good of the people they care about.

Leos want to be the center of the universe. They want to be rewarded for being the best and the brightest. They want to be given special treatment. But they also want to feel deserving of it.

What do Leos hate the most?
Leos hate being bossed around. They are very much in charge of their own destiny. Leos are perpetually wounded by what they perceive to be acts of betrayal and abandonment. Their pride is a sword that they wield to protect their autonomy.

Because their sense of honor is so intense, Leos hold both themselves and others to a very high standard. They can feel deeply wounded when someone breaks that code. There is an ingrained need for everyone to acknowledge and validate their existence. This can lead to what can be labeled as narcissistic or absolutist behavior that borders on the absurd.

Leos hate being told what to do, but if you can get them to listen, they can usually be persuaded—especially if you make them feel like it was what they wanted all along. But they’ll always secretly resent that they didn’t reach this conclusion alone. Leos don’t like to be told to do things, and they especially don't like being forced.





Who is a Leo's soulmate?
Leos desire someone who can feed them both physically and emotionally. They want to be worshipped, to feel like the focus of your attention. Leos need to know you’d do absolutely anything for them—and that you’d do it not out of obligation, but by choice. They love to feel like they’re in a position of power, but they don't want to have to exercise it by force. To them, their natural charisma should be enough. They are fiercely independent, and they love to get their way, so they tend to need partners who are a little submissive—or at least who are willing to take on that role in the relationship.

At the same time, Leos need someone who is quietly and secretly powerful in their own right, someone who can help them realize their ambitions. Someone who can help them make a name for themselves.

They need to be with someone who can get under their skin and occupy their imagination. Someone who can keep up with their endless emotional hunger. Someone who can help them feel invincible.`;

Virgos are known for being perfectionists. They are known for their attention to detail, which helps them find patterns where there are none. At times, Virgos can be finicky and critical to a fault.

It’s true that Virgos are very particular, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they keep neat spaces. Their particularities and habits don’t necessarily line up with traditional views of cleanliness. They could live in what looks like a Tasmanian devil-style dust storm ruin, but still impose a “no shoes in the house” or “no outside clothes on the bed” rule. Maybe their house looks cluttered, but they still know where everything is. Everything has its place. Virgos prefer to exist in organized spaces, but put helping others over their own comfort. A Virgo can become so busy fixing the lives of those around them that they don't put much work into providing for their own needs. Virgos are rarely motivated by their own self-interest.

Virgos are also known for being intelligent, but because of their introverted nature they can sometimes have trouble expressing themselves. Talking to them may feel like floating on the surface of existence, and like you never know what they’re thinking and feeling deep inside. Their emphasis on thoughts and ideas can seem like a cover-up for their lack of emotional depth. In reality, they are a fortress unto themselves—the definition of self-containment. Virgos will be endlessly accepting of whatever you have to share, but may not see the value in spontaneously performing a similar excavation of themselves for anyone else.

What makes Virgos happy?
To be happy, Virgos need to feel like they’re being useful. They feel productive by contributing to something larger than themselves. This is how they derive self-worth–by feeling needed.

Virgos actively seek out messes of all kinds–physical, interpersonal, emotional.They like working on busy little behind-the-scenes tasks that make life run more smoothly for everyone. Virgos need to keep going at full speed, because if they slow down, the unfolding chaos of the world catches up with them and fills their heads with constant anxiety. It’s this internal disorder that Virgos are always running from, throwing themselves at the Sisyphean task of being the world’s dustpan.

Virgos need a sense of purpose and achievement. They love setting goals and checking things off their to-do lists. What makes them happy is the feeling that they’re making an impact, or at least trying to.

What type of person is a Virgo?
Virgos are generally very modest. They want to feel acknowledged for their contributions, but they don’t need grandiose gestures of appreciation to feel valuable. They are little geniuses. They notice the details. Virgo knows when their toothbrush has been moved even a centimeter.

Virgos are insecure about the fact that they’re not perfect. They’re aware that their actions have consequences, and that they can, at times, be responsible for their own suffering. This is why you’ll often hear them saying things like “It’s my fault,” and “I did this to myself.

Virgos are the literal embodiment of the medieval philosopher who lives in a sterile cell, never opening the door for fear that people will catch a glimpse of the mess inside. Their motto is “In order to save myself from myself, I must first destroy myself.” What they want is a pure, clean existence.

They need to be the best to feel worthy of their existence. They can be so obsessed with their own image of perfection, that they lose touch with their true impulses. They repress their feelings by locking them away in order to achieve a state of impassivity.

They can come off as far more rational than they really are. Their feelings are generally a great mystery to them. They feel so many things so deeply, but they usually don’t know how to talk about it. The only way they can express the ineffable is through dry sarcasm.


Who are Virgos attracted to?
Despite their self-professed perfectionism, Virgos can be attracted to a wide variety of people. Virgos are not superficial. They can find the beauty in things that most people would dismiss as unappealing.

Initially, a Virgo might be drawn to someone because they are trying to fulfill some need in themselves. Virgos have a tendency to be attracted to people who are slightly unstable. It’s mostly because they want to put someone else back together. Of course, they always feel they have the capacity to tap into another person's deepest emotional truths. This belief often gets them in situations where they get taken advantage of, or feel like they have to be someone’s only savior. At worst, their relationships can start to feel transactional.`;

Libras are difficult to really understand because they seem so contradictory. They’re simultaneously extroverted and introverted, strategic and spontaneous, focused and intuitive. This variability makes it difficult to pin down their true character. They are an entire constellation of personalities.

Libras are different depending on who they're around. This is because they value empathy and want to be receptive. They can be other people’s mirrors. While they have strong opinions about other people, it can take a long time for them to understand themselves.

Libras want to be admired not for their talents but for their charm. They want to be seen as the responsible figure who can balance out the turbulent elements around them. Libras feel an intense amount of guilt and shame when they are unhappy because they know that their unhappiness affects everyone around them.

What are a Libra's weaknesses?
Libras are compassionate and empathetic people. They are willing to go out of their way to help others. They dislike conflict and avoid confrontations. These traits lead them to be manipulated by others. Libras also have a tendency to be indecisive. They are so concerned about other people's feelings that they let other people make decisions for them.

Libras put a lot of weight on the opinions of others. Although they are secretly terrified of negative judgment, they have a hard time avoiding the spotlight. They need to be noticed in order to feel validated.

What Libras need to discover is that positivity is its own kind of delusion. Libras are bound by the limitations of their bodies and their minds. They are contained within the boundaries of what their five senses tell them. They are able to understand the flavor of the world, but not the color. They’re not able to interpret the underlying micro-signals that others can. The dark abyss of the unknown is a terrifying place for them, which is why they have to pretend that they know everything. They project an air of omniscience. But in truth, they have no idea what they are talking about.

What are Libras afraid of?
Libras are afraid of being alone. A fear of being disconnected from the collective is part of their primal psychological makeup. Libras are afraid of the unknown. They’re afraid of their own secrets. They are capable of organizing their lives with such complex structure that they rarely face truly unknown situations.

Libras fear that they will live their lives in a constant state of fear. They fear that fear will constantly dictate their behavior. That fear will impede their ability to be happy. That fear will prevent them from achieving their goals. Libras are afraid that this fear will accumulate into an insurmountable obstacle.


Who is a Libra's soulmate?
Libras are most identifiable by the contrast between their exteriors and interiors. Their exteriors are sophisticated and composed, while their interiors are insecure and a constant state of flux. A Libra's soulmate is someone who can bridge this dichotomy.

A Libra's soulmate is someone who is agreeable without being a doormat. Libras need someone who can be there for them in their most disorienting moments. Their soulmate should be a lighthouse to guide them out of their own fog.

A Libra soulmate is someone who understands that Libra has a darkness in them, but that darkness is a natural part of them. It’s not something to be ashamed of. A Libra soulmate is someone who encourages them to keep being themselves. Someone who helps them see that they’re in control of themselves`;

A Scorpio's personality is a chasm of infinite complexity (or at least how they project themselves). They are difficult people to get to know because they are psychological trap doors.

Scorpios socialize from behind a double-sided mirror, always scanning, reading you while you can only see your own reflection. They prefer to be the people asking the questions, removing your skin with their perceptive scalpel and taking inventory of your pulsing viscera. They subtly probe and push your pressure points so they can get the answer they're seeking. Scorpios are keenly aware of power, its flows, and their position within its matrix.

Despite their ability to be popular, there’s something very lonely about Scorpios. They have a ruthless view of the world. Eat or be eaten. Their knowledge of other people’s internal structures gives them an edge over the competition. They know how to play people against each other. Every human interaction is a meeting of opposing powerful forces. A clashing of wants and needs where somebody wins and somebody loses. They are forthcoming and evasive at the same time, depending on what is situationally beneficial. They are blunt, but not without tact. They are intentional about the information they reveal. They’re not liars, they don't spread lies, but they are masters of opening windows on certain truths while concealing others behind heavy curtains.

What are Scorpios afraid of?
Scorpios aren’t afraid of most things other people fear. Not darkness. Not pain. Not death. They confront these truths head on.

Instead of instilling fear, this acknowledgement of darkness is the whetstone that hones their appreciation for life. Scorpios teeter on the fine edge of the unknowable. Life is more bearable that way.

Scorpios do fear vulnerability because they are scared of being known. Darkness can be a hiding place. Pain can be an excuse not to trust. When they open up, it gives other people power over them, and Scorpios need to be in control. Control–over themselves and others–is an illusion to make them feel secure in an otherwise uncertain world.


What are Scorpios attracted to?
Scorpios are attracted to what’s under the surface. They want to be with someone who pushes their boundaries, who brings out their most intense desires and most profound fears. Intrigue. Passion. Lust. The need for completion. A darkly seductive energy. A screen for projection. An enigmatic intensity. The forbidden and the unknown.

They have the ability to see past the mask of pretense to the soul of desire, and they look for people who can see and appreciate this part of them. Scorpios are into things that are real. They are into people who are not afraid to say what they mean.

Scorpios are not interested in anything that doesn’t involve the risk of being completely destroyed. They want to have as many dramatic experiences as possible because the absence of friction is a kind of subtle death.

But even though Scorpios are attracted to passion, they are also repelled by it. They want to desire things, but they don’t want to be ruled by their desires. This is why they will sometimes date people who are the exact opposite of what they claim to want.`;

Sagittarians are the ultimate empiricists. They will always choose principles over feelings and will often question who they are. They move from job to job, philosophy to philosophy, belief to belief. They are explorers of the human condition and are unafraid of change. Sagittarians feel like the world is their playground. They love to explore the unknown. At their core, they want to understand how the world works.

On an unbounded quest to discover the whole of the universe inside of themselves, Sagittarians are unshackled from any particular worldly attachment. They are reckless in their pursuit of what they want, and often end up doing and experiencing things that defy conceptions of the possible.

Sagittarians are explorers. They are both the fearless adventurers and the jaded critics. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind that comes from within. Sagittarians know that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful.

What are a Sagittarian's weaknesses?
A Sagittarius is both a warrior and a poet. They hold a firearm in one hand and a book in the other. They encapsulate a relentless drive for freedom. They are one of the most magnanimous and worldly signs in the zodiac. Their boundless optimism is infectious. It can be hard for them to find focus, but once they have their mind set on something they’ll stop at nothing to achieve it. Their ability to overcome insurmountable challenges is testament to their adaptable strength.

Why is Sagittarius so special
Sagittarians can be overly aspirational. They want to believe so intensely that they can transcend the limitations of reality that it’s hard for them to accept life's simple joys. Sagittarians can be so focused on achieving their goals that they don’t stop to appreciate the small victories along the way. At times, their high standards make them seem dismissive and arrogant


What do Sagittarians find attractive?
Sagittarians are looking for someone to have a good time with. They want to be able to experience the world without having to worry about the consequences of their actions or getting tied down. They need someone who doesn’t take life too seriously.

To Sagittarians, brains are the hottest part of the body. Because they're ruled by the planet of wisdom, they appreciate people who have an intellectual edge, a way with words, and a sharp sense of humor. Sagittarians are attracted to the kind of person who inspires them to think bigger thoughts, to open themselves up to the infinite. They feel the most alive when they are around people who bring out the philosopher in them.`;

Capricorns aren’t consumed by the need for attention, but are not immune to it. They simply don’t indulge in attention-seeking behavior. Capricorns don’t want attention for their looks or style or ingenuity. They don’t want to be admired, but they do want to be respected. They don’t care to be the center of attention. Instead it’s like they need to prove their own abilities to themselves. They plow through adversity with blinders on until they reach success.

Capricorns are constantly competing with themselves. They do want praise, though. Praise is a simple acknowledgment of a job well done. Praise is a pat on the back. They use this as validation to compensate for general feelings of incompetence and inferiority.

What kind of person is a Capricorn?
Capricorns are masters of discipline. The wringing of the hands, the constant reminders, the exacting structure, the ever-increasing goals, the tidal wave of self-criticism that lasts forever. They are the ultimate perfectionists. They can be so absorbed in their own internal monologue that it becomes impossible to get them to look away from themselves. Capricorns are often called “workaholics.”

They are incredibly pragmatic. Capricorns are rule followers with a highly developed moral compass. From a young age, it is impressed upon them that their whole sense of worth and meaning is based on their ability to hunker down and force their way to the finish line. Their drive to succeed is a reflection of their fear of failure. The most stressful time in a Capricorn’s life is when they question their own authority. When a Capricorn is in a position of power, they are most stable. When they’re put in a position where they have to cater to someone else’s agenda, they can become a little unhinged.

Capricorns collect responsibility. And they always seem to take it all on. Capricorns need to be the one to fix everything. Responsibility is their natural state. They have a “can do” attitude. Capricorns are both the martyrs and the champions. They are the guardians and the judges. The team captains. The chief of chiefs. The general. The leader. But even as they lead the charge, Capricorns can feel like the loneliest people in the world. They wish to be completely self-sufficient, because they are so scared of depending on others.


What do Capricorns find attractive?
Capricorns do not want your mess. They admire other people who are self-sufficient, who inspire them in some way. Capricorns are motivated by respect. They are drawn to people who give them the sense that they know something, or who have an exceptional understanding of some arcane corner of the world. They will be impressed if you can speak to technical details or philosophical matters in depth.

Capricorns want to be the one to take the lead, because they have a desire to control and command a situation. They want to direct the scene. They aren’t attracted to people who’re a little bit on the loose side. They’re much more interested in people who are guarded, not overly emotional or dramatic. People who are more even-keeled. Capricorns are attracted to people who share the same values as them, or at least respect those values.

Aquarians are archetypal outcasts. This doesn’t mean they’re loners. In fact, they thrive in large groups—charming you with their peculiar senses of humor, intriguing you with fun facts about the history of disposable straws, or convincing you to join their reading groups. The alienation they feel is often self-imposed—a result of their knee-jerk contrarianism, rather than a lack of social intelligence. They try to be weird. Aquarians hang grapefruit rinds from the wall and call it art, they pretend to actually like noise music, they saturate their internal monologues with SAT words.

Intelligence, to them, means the ability to formulate the most unpopular opinion possible. If they were white sheep, they’d dye their wool black just to prove a point. They are destined to live their lives in direct opposition to the current world. In fact, they are world-builders. An entire universe exists in their heads, and this universe adheres to its own set of logic that doesn’t map onto reality. They aren't anarchists. They are utopians. They are not cold. They are rational. To them, emotions are just holes in their idealistic vessels. Why succumb to sensitivity when there is so much knowledge to acquire, so many problems to be solved, worlds to invent?

They sometimes ask, “Why can’t I be normal?” but in reality, they find normalcy boring. They want to be unknowable. Aquarians want to evade definition. Definitions are binding little rules that other people use to restrict their movement, and they must resist anything that infringes on their freedom to drift. Between definitions, between the individual and the common, between themselves and humanity. The ultimate Aquarian struggle is resolving the tension between their need for community, and their need for complete detachment.

Aquarians are always running little tests. They live their lives as one big science experiment, using the element of surprise to collect reactions and construct theories about the intricacies of human nature. They are walking abstract art pieces, shattering traditional perspectives with their complete disregard for convention. They are martyrs to the cause of humanity. Freedom is their only demand.

  Are Aquarians loyal?
Aquarians make very good acquaintances. They are friendly people, but their enigmatic nature makes them difficult to get close to. You can know an Aquarius for years and still feel like you don’t know anything about their personal lives. When you ask them about themselves, they talk about the impending environmental catastrophe, or repeat facts from the last documentary they watched.

Aquarians want to be helpful, but this attentiveness is frequently directed at the people they know the least. They may borrow your sweater without asking, then pass it on to a stranger on the train who looked cold. It’s as if their duty to humanity trumps any sense of responsibility they might feel towards the people closest to them. They think it’s selfishly biased to prioritize close friendships over everyone else in the world, so they stroke their humanistic ego by projecting themselves as the selfless giver.

Aquarians are personality collectors. They tend to surround themselves with a curated cast of strange characters, but never get to know them beneath their surface-level attributes. Deep connections based on shared sensibilities are not necessarily the most interesting ones. Aquarians want to learn from people who are as different from them as possible. They’re terrified of falling into the complacent herd mentality of a single friend group.

Aquarians aren’t necessarily the friends you seek out when you’re in a crisis. They want to support you, but their problem-solving mind short-circuits trying to come up with the objectively right thing to say. Turn to them when you’re hungry for a strange adventure that will turn into an entertaining story to tell at parties—or if you want someone to explain what ontology means.`;

Describing a Pisces’ personality can be difficult because Pisces tend to evade distinction. Their behavior changes significantly based on who they’re around. Pisces are just permeable membranes that pensively let things flow through them. They are cerebral sea sponges. They are boundless, diluting themselves with larger personalities to avoid having to form coherent identities.

Most of the qualities usually associated with Pisces (dreaminess, emotionality, imagination) are internal processes that are difficult to observe from the outside. Pisces are primarily inward-facing. They are not self-absorbed, but they are absorbed in themselves.

Ultimately, a Pisces wants to dissolve. To wrest themselves of a physical form and diffuse into everything they touch as love. To exist in the gossamer liminal layer that hangs just barely above the material. To live their life like a romantic poem. To understand that reality and fantasy are neighbors on the same infinite plane.

What are Pisces weaknesses?
The true Pisces weakness is that they’re often the cause of their own turmoil. They’re a little bit addicted to melancholy. Pisces want to feel things intensely. Pisces find sorrow's poignance pleasurable. They would rather marinate in a voluptuous pit of despair than have no feelings at all. The search for heart-rending emotional experiences sometimes causes Pisces to seek out situations that are subconsciously self-defeating.


Who is a Pisces's soulmate?
There is a tension between what Pisces need in a partner and what they want. They want a love that overpowers them. Pisces need to know that it’s okay to be sculpted by love, but that there has to be something definite. Some hard wire underneath all the malleability. Love is not a complete absence of a self, or a full dissolution into someone else. The right partner already knows this and encourages Pisces to build rudimentary walls. A Pisces soulmate is someone who's rooted in reality while still being susceptible to romance.`;
